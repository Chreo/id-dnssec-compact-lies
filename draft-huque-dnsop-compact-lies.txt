                   draft-huque-dnsop-compact-lies-00

Abstract

   This document describes a technique to generate a signed DNS response
   on demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists
   but doesn't have any data for the queried record type.  Such answers
   require only one NSEC record and allow online signing servers to
   minimize signing operations and response sizes.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   One of the functions of the Domain Name System Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC) [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] [RFC5155] is "Authenticated
   Denial of Existence", i.e. proving that a DNS name or record type
   does not exist.  Normally, this is done by means of signed NSEC or
   NSEC3 records.  In the precomputed signature model, these records
   chain together existing names, or cryptographic hashes of them in the
   zone.  In the online signing model, described in NSEC and NSEC3
   "White Lies" [RFC4470] [RFC7129], they are used to dynamically
   compute an epsilon function around the queried name.  A 'type bitmap'
   in the data field of the NSEC or NSEC3 record asserts which resource
   record types are present at the name.

   The response for a non-existent name requires up to 2 signed NSEC
   records or up to 3 signed NSEC3 records (and for online signers, the
   associated cryptographic computation), to prove that (1) the name did
   not explicitly exist in the zone, and (2) that it could not have been
   synthesized by a wildcard.

   This document describes an alternative technique, "Compact Answers",
   to generate a signed DNS response on demand for a non-existent name
   by claiming that the name exists but has no resource records
   associated with the queried type, i.e. it returns a NODATA response
   rather than an NXDOMAIN response.  A NODATA response (which has a
   response code of NOERROR, and an empty ANSWER section) requires only
   one NSEC record matching the queried name.  This has two advantages:
   the DNS response size is smaller, and it reduces the online
   cryptographic work involved in generating the response.

2.  Distinguishing NXDOMAIN from Empty Non-Terminal Names

   Since NODATA responses are generated for non-existent names, and
   there are no defined record types for the name, the NSEC type bitmap
   in the response will only contain "NSEC" and "RRSIG".  Tools that
   need to accurately identify non-existent names in responses cannot
   rely on this specific type bitmap because Empty Non-Terminal (ENT)
   names (which positively exist) also have no record types at the name
   and will return exactly the same type bitmap.

   Implementations exists today of Compact answers that avoids the
   NXDOMAIN identification problem by synthesizing the NSEC type bitmap
   for ENTs to include all record types supported except for the queried
   type.  This has the undesirable effect of no longer being able to
   reliably determine the existence of ENTs, as well as not allowing
   resolvers to properly signal NXDOMAIN to clients querying without
   DNSSECOK flag set.

   This document defines the use of a synthetic Resource Record type to
   signal the presence of an Empty Non-Terminal name.  The mnemonic for
   this RR type is "ENT" and its type code is [TBD].  This RR type is
   added to the NSEC type bitmap for responses to ENTs.  No special
   handling of this RR type is needed on the part of DNS resolvers.  In
   addition, this document also defines the use of a synthetic Resource
   Record type to signal an NXDOMAIN answer, using the mnemonic of
   "NXNAME" with the type code [TBD].  The inclusion of NXNAME in the
   NSEC bitmap allows resolvers implementing this document to upgrade
   answers from NODATA to NXDOMAIN for non-validating clients.  No
   special handling of this RR type is needed for DNS resolvers opting
   to not implement NXNAME.  The moniker NXNAME is chosen to distinguish
   it from the response code NXDOMAIN.

3.  Responses for Non-Existent Names

   When an authoritative server implementing Compact Answers receives a
   query for a non-existent name in a zone that it serves, a NODATA
   response (response code NOERROR, empty Answer section) is generated
   with a dynamically constructed NSEC record with the owner name
   matching the queried name (QNAME).

   The next name SHOULD be set to the immediate lexicographic successor
   of the QNAME.  The generated NSEC record's type bitmap MUST have only
   the RRSIG, NSEC, and NXNAME bits set.

   For example, a request for the non-existing name a.example.com would
   cause the following NSEC record to be generated (in DNS presentation
   format):

          a.example.com. 3600 IN NSEC \000.a.example.com. RRSIG NSEC NXNAME

   Note that this RR type only appears in the type bitmap of an NSEC
   record in response to a query for what would've been NXDOMAIN to a
   non-validating client.  A resolver MAY choose to translate the
   returned NSEC record to an NXDOMAIN answer (RCODE=3), to clients that
   do not ask for DNSSEC answers.

   The NSEC record MUST have corresponding RRSIGs generated.

4.  Responses for Wildcard Matches

   For wildcard matches, a Compact Answers implementation will typically
   provide a dynamically signed response that claims that the queried
   name exists explicitly.  This obviates the need to include an NSEC
   record in the Additional section of the response that shows that no
   closer match than the wildcard was possible.

   Similarly, Wildcard NODATA responses (where the queried name matches
   a wildcard but no data for the queried type exists), a response akin
   to a regular NODATA is returned.  The Answer section is empty, and
   the Additional section contains a single NSEC record that matches the
   query name with a type bitmap representing the list of types
   available at the wildcard.

5.  Responses for Empty Non-Terminals

   When an authoritative server implementing Compact Answers receives a
   query for an Empty Non-Terminal name, it generates a NODATA response
   in the usual way, except that it adds the additional Empty Non-
   Terminal distinguisher RR type code in the NSEC type bitmap field.
   Corresponding RRSIG signature record(s) MUST also be generated.

          ent1.example.net.  3600 IN NSEC \000.ent.example.net. RRSIG NSEC ENT

   Note that this RR type only appears in the type bitmap of an NSEC
   record in response to a query for an Empty Non-Terminal name.  It
   causes no special processing on the part of validating resolvers.
   Queries for the ENT RR type itself at an actual Empty Non-Terminal
   MUST also elicit the response described in this section.

6.  Operational Implications

   A signed zone at an authoritative server implementing Compact Answers
   will never return a response with a response code of NXDOMAIN.  Tools
   that rely on accurately determining non-existent names will need to
   infer them from the NSEC type bitmap pattern of "NSEC RRSIG NXNAME".

   Address lookup functions typically invoked by applications won't see
   a practical impact from this indistinguishability.  For a non-
   existent name, the getaddrinfo() function for example will return an
   exit code of EAI_NODATA rather than EAI_NONAME.  But either way the
   effect on the caller is the same: it will obtain a response with a
   non-zero exit code and no available addresses.

7.  Implementation Status

   Cloudflare, NS1, and Amazon Route53 currently implement the base
   Compact Answers scheme.  NS1 additonally implements the Empty Non-
   Terminal distinguisher in the NSEC type bitmap, using the private RR
   type code 65281.  Cloudflare currently also additonally implements
   the ENT and NNAME distinguisher in the NSEC type bitmap, using the
   private RR type codes 65281, and 65283 respectively (in progress).

8.  Security Considerations

   Online signing of DNS records requires authoritative servers for the
   DNS zone to have access to the private signing keys.  Exposing
   signing keys on Internet reachable servers makes them more vulnerable
   to attack.

   Additionally, generating signatures on-demand is more computationally
   intensive than returning pre-computed signatures.  Although the
   Compact Answers scheme reduces the number of online signing
   operations compared to previous techniques like RFC4470, it still may
   make authoritative servers more vulnerable to computational denial of
   service attacks than pre-computed signatures.  The use of signature
   algorithms (like those based on Elliptic Curves) that have a
   comparatively low cost for signing is recommended.

9.  Acknowledgements

   The Compact Answers technique (then called "Black Lies") was
   originally proposed in [COMPACT-LIES] by F.  Valsorda and O.
   Gudmunsson, and implemented by Cloudflare.  The Empty Non-Terminal
   distinguisher RR type was originally proposed in [ENT-SENTINEL] by S.
   Huque.  The NXNAME type is based on the original proposal in
   [NXDOMAIN-TYPE] by O.  Gudmunsson and F.  Valsorda, and implemented
   by Cloudflare.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new DNS Resource Record type code for
   the Empty Non-Terminal distinguisher in the DNS parameters registry:
