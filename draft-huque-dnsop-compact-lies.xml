    <abstract>
     <t>
       This document describes a technique to generate a signed DNS response
       on demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists
       but doesn't have any data for the queried record type. Such answers
       require only one NSEC record and allow online signing servers to
       minimize signing operations and packet size.

      <name>Introduction and Motivation</name>
      <t>
        One of the functions of the Domain Name System Security Extensions
        (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" /> <xref target="RFC4034" />
        <xref target="RFC4035" /> <xref target="RFC5155" /> is
        "Authenticated Denial of Existence",
        i.e. proving that a DNS name or record type does not exist.
        Normally, this is done by means of NSEC or NSEC3 records. In the
        precomputed signature model, these records chain together existing
        names, or cryptographic hashes of them in the zone. In the online
        signing model, described in NSEC and NSEC3 "White Lies"
        <xref target="RFC4470" /> <xref target="RFC7129" />,
        they are used to dynamically compute an epsilon
        function around the queried name. A 'type bitmap' in the data field
        of the NSEC or NSEC3 record asserts which resource record types are
        present at the associated name.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes an alternative technique, "Compact Lies",
        to generate a signed DNS response on demand for a non-existent
        name by claiming that the name exists but has no resource records
        associated with the queried type, i.e. it returns a NODATA response
        rather than an NXDOMAIN response. A NODATA response (which has a
        response code of NOERROR, and an empty ANSWER section) requires
        only one NSEC record matching the queried name. This has two
        advantages: the DNS response size is smaller, and it reduces the
        online cryptographic work involved in generating the response. By
        contrast, an NXDOMAIN response requires multiple records (up to 2
        when using NSEC, and up to 3 when using NSEC3, and the associated
        computation) to prove that (1) the name did not explicitly exist in
        the zone, and (2) that it could not have been synthesized by a
        wildcard.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Distinguishing NXDOMAIN from Empty Non-Terminal Names</name>
      <t>
        Since NODATA responses are generated for non-existent names, and
        there are no defined record types for the name, the NSEC type
        bitmap in the response will only contain "NSEC" and "RRSIG".
        Tools that need to accurately identify non-existent names in
        responses cannot rely on this specific type bitmap because Empty
        Non-Terminal (ENT) names (which positively exist) also have no
        record types at the name and will return exactly the same type
        bitmap.
      </t>
      <t>
        Today, one specific implementation of Compact Lies avoids the
        NXDOMAIN identification problem by synthesizing the NSEC type
        bitmap for ENTs to include all record types supported except for
        the queried type. This has the undesirable effect though of no
        longer being able to reliably determine the existence of ENTs.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document thus proposes the use of a synthetic Resource Record
        type to signal the presence of an Empty Non-Terminal name.
        This RR type is added to the NSEC type bitmap for responses
        to ENTs. Currently, the deployed examples of this scheme
        are using the private RR type code 65281. So the resulting
        type bitmap would have "NSEC RRSIG TYPE65281". This document
        requests a formal allocation of an RR type code. Note that no
        special handling of this RR type is needed on the part of DNS
        resolvers.
      </t>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Generating Compact Lies for Non-Existent Names</name>
      <t>
        When an authoritative server implementing compact lists receives
        a query for a non-existent name in a zone that it serves, a
        NODATA response (response code NOERROR, empty Answer section) is
        generated with a dynamically constructed NSEC record with the
        owner name matching the queried name (QNAME).
      </t>
      <t>
       The next name SHOULD be set to the immediate lexicographic successor
       of the QNAME. The generated NSEC record's type bitmap MUST have only
       the RRSIG and NSEC bits set.
      </t>
      <t>
       For example, a request for the non-existing name a.example.com would
       cause the following NSEC record to be generated (in DNS presentation
       format):
      </t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
          a.example.com. 3600 IN NSEC \000.a.example.com. RRSIG NSEC
        ]]></artwork>

      <t>
       The NSEC record MUST have corresponding RRSIGs generated.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Generating Compact Lies for Empty Non-Terminals</name>
      <t>
        When an authoritative server implementing compact lists receives
        a query for an Empty Non-Terminal name, it generates a NODATA
        response in the usual way, except that it adds the additional
        Empty Non-Terminal distinguisher RR type code in the NSEC type
        bitmap field. Corresponding RRSIG signature record(s) MUST also
        be generated.
      </t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
          ent1.example.net.  3600 IN NSEC \000.ent.example.net. RRSIG NSEC ENT
        ]]></artwork>
      <t>
        The RR type code for "ENT" is [TBD]. Note that this RR type only
        appears in the type bitmap of an NSEC record in responses to
        an Empty Non-Terminal name as described in this document. It
        causes no special processing on the part of validating resolvers.
        Queries for the ENT RR type itself at an actual Empty Non-Terminal
        name at an authoritative server implementing Compact Lies MUST
        elicit the response described in this section.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Operational Implications</name>
      <t>
        A signed zone at an authoritative server implementing Compact
        Lies will never return a response with a response code of
        NXDOMAIN. Tools that rely on accurately determining non-existent
        responses will need to infer them from the NSEC type bitmap pattern
        of "NSEC RRSIG".
      </t>

      <t>
        Cloudflare, NS1, and Amazon Route53 currently implement the base
        Compact Lies scheme. NS1 additonally implements the Empty
        Non-Terminal distinguisher in the NSEC type bitmap.
